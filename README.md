# css-assignment (13 May 2015)
**Purpose of the visual styling:**
- Colour: I decided to choose a green colour theme because the purpose of this portfolio piece is to grow others, and green symbolises growth. I also used a colour palette which passes AAA constrast checks for accessbility meaning the white text on the dark green background, and black text on light green background meets the highest standard in terms of colour contrast.
- Typography: I chose Lora for my headings (h1 and h2), and Open Sans for the body text (p) because both fonts are quite legible. I decided to choose Open Sans for the body text because its a clean, calm and legible font. I wanted something a little more decorative for the headings, but still readable, so I to pair Lora with Open Sans
- Layout: I kept to a simple layout and used blocks to divide the differnt sections of my website,. I added rounded corners to the blocks to give it a softer and friendly feel.

**How these choices supports my portfolioâ€™s overall theme:**
- I wanted to bring a sense of growth and calmness to the portfolio as its about growing other designers. I think the styles that I chose, i.e green colour palette, rounded shapes and a calm typography represent my intention around this.

**Validating my stylesheet:**
- I validated my css code by using the direct iput option on W3C CSS Validation Service. I pasted the css code, and there were no errors found. There was also some guidance provided to add W3C verified CSS icon to my html, so I decided it add it to the footer.

**A short reflection:**

Challenges
- I had challenges trying to style the navigation bar as I am not sure how to all the brand name/logo and the navigation links in one line.
- I also struggled to position the navigation bar to aligned to flush to the edges of the page.
- I normally figure out layout and UI in Figma first, but this time I started directly in HTML and CSS, which made it a bit harder to plan.

- Things I tried out:
-   I looked at examples on how to style navigation bar on https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp which helped me get most of it correct.
-   I added font weight (700) to the contact section and removed the <strong> tags and replaced it with <span class=emphasis>.
-   For the image I added styles to css, and removed the inline width from the html. I added rounded corners and width to the css.

**My theme of choice:**
- A few designers have recently reached out to me on LinkedIn, or via someone I've worked with in the past, to get feedback on their designs and portfolios. This inspired me to create a mentorship page, i.e. a central space where designers can reach out to me and receive support and guidance.
- I thought "Amentor" was a cool but simple enough idea to execute for the purposes of this assignment.

**Purpose of each section:**
- Header: Contains name of the brand I created, i.e. "Amentor".
- Navigation: Tailored specifically for this simple website - about me, what I offer, how to get in touch and a link to my linkedin profile.
- Main and footer: Separates the main content on the page and the footer.
- Sections: I have 4 sections on my html page:
-   1st section (intro): Introducing my brand or theme.
-   2nd section (about): Tells designers more about who I am and features a photo of me.
-   3rd section (offerings): More about what I can offer.
-   4th section (contact): How to contact me and the criteria for different types of guidance.

**The multimedia element:**
- I used a headshot of myself in the about section, so that designers know who they are reaching out to/ who their mentor will be.
- The image is in .jpg format.
- I added this .jpg in my html-assignment folder.
- Then, I integrated it into the html file by using the semantic img tag, using the exact file name because it is in the same folder as my index.html file. I also added alt text which follows best practices according to University of South Carolina, and I also added a width constraint to the image.
