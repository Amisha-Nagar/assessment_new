# html-assignment
**My theme of choice:**
- A few designers have recently reached out to me on LinkedIn, or via someone I've worked with in the past, to get feedback on their designs and portfolios. This inspired me to create a mentorship page, i.e. a central space where designers can reach out to me and receive support and guidance.
- I thought "Amentor" was a cool but simple enough idea to execute for the purposes of this assignment.

**Purpose of each section:**
- Header: Contains name of the brand I created, i.e. "Amentor".
- Navigation: Tailored specifically for this simple website - about me, what I offer, how to get in touch and a link to my linkedin profile.
- Main and footer: Separates the main content on the page and the footer.
- Sections: I have 4 sections on my html page:
-   1st section (intro): Introducing my brand or theme.
-   2nd section (about): Tells designers more about who I am and features a photo of me.
-   3rd section (offerings): More about what I can offer.
-   4th section (contact): How to contact me and the criteria for different types of guidance.

**The multimedia element:**
- I used a headshot of myself in the about section, so that designers know who they are reaching out to/ who their mentor will be.
- The image is in .jpg format.
- I added this .jpg in my html-assignment folder.
- Then, I integrated it into the html file by using the semantic img tag, using the exact file name because it is in the same folder as my index.html file. I also added alt text which follows best practices according to University of South Carolina, and I also added a width constraint to the image.
